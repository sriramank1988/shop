CRUD shop Ruby app

Problem :
Licensing cost for Netsuite application is expensive and they charge per user.
It is impacting the Bottom line of Nuts and Bolts Pty Ltd.
They wanted to build a in house technology team and maintain their own web app.
They have hired a developer (Thats me) for a week to prove them it is worth investing on a developer
